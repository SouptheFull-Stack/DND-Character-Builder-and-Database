                            <p>Rolling die is an integral part of Dungeons & Dragons and is central to resolving various actions, especially in combat.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>From attacks to spells and healing, each roll involves throwing dice and adding any relevant modifiers or bonuses. Whether facing foes or casting spells, the roll's result often decides success or failure.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>In general, the D4, D6, D8, D10 and D12 are used for weapons damage, attacks, spells and healing amounts. D20 dice are used most often to see if an attempted action succeeds.​</p>
